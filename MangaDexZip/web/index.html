                <h2>Additional info</h2>
                <p>When downloading a Manga, the default language when looking for chapters is <strong>English</strong>. To override this, simply add the following to the end of your address bar:&nbsp;<code><strong>?lang=LANG</strong></code>&nbsp;where&nbsp;<code>LANG</code>&nbsp;is a valid MangaDex language tag, i.e.:&nbsp;<code>?lang=fr</code></p>
                <p>When downloading a Manga or Chapter, you can always download a slimmed down, lighter version of it by appending the following to the end of your address bar:&nbsp;<code><strong>?light=1</strong></code></p>
                <p><strong>NB: </strong>If you're adding multiple parameters, be sure to name the first one after a&nbsp;<code>?</code>, and the subsequent parameters with a&nbsp;<code>&amp;</code>. Here's an example:&nbsp;<code>https://<strong>mangadex.zip</strong>/title/b9797c5b-642e-44d9-ac40-8b31b9ae110a<strong>?lang=fr&amp;light=1</strong></code></p>
                <p>Selecting a primary translation group, automatically appending the chapter's title or only download a range of chapters are planned features and will be coming soon.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>This entire site counts as "one" entity when downloading from MangaDex. As such, we had to develop a Fair-Queue system.</p>
                <p>Any download is considered a "task". You may have as many tasks as you wish in the queue, but they will be processed in a round-robin fashion. Said queue is shared with with multiple users.</p>

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <h2>Hello, developers</h2>
                <p>We offer an API available&nbsp;<a href="/redoc">here</a>. The API consists of 2 major parts: adding items to the queue, and retrieving your items.</p>
